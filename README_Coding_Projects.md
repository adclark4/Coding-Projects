# Coding Projects

## üìå Overview
This repository is a collection of my **Python projects**, ranging from data analytics dashboards to small utility scripts.  
It serves as a portfolio to showcase my skills in **data science, software engineering, and practical problem-solving**.  

The repo is organized into subfolders for larger projects and a `Misc` folder for smaller standalone scripts.
